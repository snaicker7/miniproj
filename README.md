# miniproj

This project is the cleaner version of https://github.com/snaicker7/go-Kafka-postgres
https://github.com/snaicker7/go-Kafka-postgres -> this project is a running project without test case and lots of dead and unwanted code
with the miniproject, I still needs to write more test cases. There are chances that the miniproj may not be running. But I am continuously working on it.
I will ensure that it runs and I properly containerized using docker but as of now all I tried to do with the mini proj is to write test driver code with clean coding and use appropriate interfaces where ever required.
